"""Phase B of issue #715 — 3-way merge for diverged shared files.

The #715 guard stopped `add-service`/`add-component` from clobbering
hand-edited shared files, but it could only *preserve and warn* — the new
component's wiring never reached a diverged file. Phase B upgrades the
diverged branch of `ManualUpdater._regenerate_shared_files` to a real
3-way merge:

    base   = template render at the project's *current* answers
    ours   = template render at the *updated* answers (the delta)
    theirs = the file on disk (with user edits)

Non-conflicting template changes are merged into the user's file
automatically. Overlapping changes produce git-style conflict markers and
are reported for manual resolution. Python files are normalized through
ruff first (so formatting noise doesn't create spurious conflicts); other
files merge as-is. If the merge can't run (git/ruff missing), it falls
back to the #715 preserve+warn behavior so nothing is ever clobbered.

# The 3-way merge shells out to ``ruff`` (3× normalize) and ``git
# merge-file`` per merged file. Under ``pytest -n auto``, those forks get
# starved by the subprocess-heavy ``generated_stacks`` tests on sibling
# workers (copier/uv bursts → EAGAIN), and the merge silently falls back to
# preserve, flaking these assertions. Pinning to the same xdist group puts
# them on the same worker as those heavy tests — loadgroup runs a worker's
# tests serially, so the merge never races the fork bursts; the other
# workers run lightweight unit tests. See the retry budget in
# ``manual_updater._run_ruff`` / ``template_cleanup.merge_three_way_text``.
