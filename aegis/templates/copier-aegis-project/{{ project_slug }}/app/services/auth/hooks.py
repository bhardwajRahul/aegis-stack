"""Extension points for the auth service.

Hooks let downstream applications inject behavior into the UserService
flow without subclassing or monkey-patching. Today there's one hook:
``post_user_created``, which fires when a brand-new ``User`` row is
inserted by either the password-signup path or an OAuth signup that
creates a fresh local user.

How to subscribe
----------------
At app startup (e.g. in your integrations module or a startup hook),
register a coroutine::

    from app.services.auth.hooks import register_post_user_created

    async def ensure_default_workspace(db, user):
        ...  # stage rows on db; do NOT commit

    register_post_user_created(ensure_default_workspace)

Contract
--------
* Hooks run **inside** the UserService's open transaction. Stage rows
  on the provided session and let the caller commit. Calling
  ``db.commit()`` from a hook breaks the surrounding atomicity.
* Hooks fire in registration order. A hook that raises aborts the
  transaction (the new user is not persisted).
* Idempotency is the hook's responsibility: a hook may be called for
  the same user more than once if a downstream app wires it into more
  than one new-user moment.
