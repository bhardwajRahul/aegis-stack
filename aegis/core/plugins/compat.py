"""
Plugin compatibility checking against the current project.

Used by ``aegis plugins list`` and ``aegis plugins info`` (#769) to tell
the user whether a discovered plugin can be added to their project, and
why not if it can't.

Checks declared on each ``PluginSpec`` against the project's
``.copier-answers.yml`` (which records the components/services already
included, and the list of installed plugins). Strictly read-only — no
side effects on the project.

Plugin-version compatibility against the running Aegis CLI version
(e.g. ``required_aegis_version`` semver matching) is **not** part of
R4-A's surface; that wiring lands with ticket #777. Until then, version
checking is a no-op here.
