"""Operator-visible behavior changes, declared per template version.

``aegis update`` moves a project across template versions, and some of
those versions change what the running app *does* - not just its code.
The case that motivated this (#1029): 0.6.12 put the Flet dashboard behind
the auth service's login view whenever ``include_auth`` is on. A public
demo updated across that line came back as a gated app, and nothing in the
update output said so or named the flag that keeps the old behavior.

Nothing here is inferred. Deriving "this diff changes behavior" from a
template diff means a rule per release forever, and a model summarising
the changelog is out of scope for a CLI that must run offline. Instead
the author declares the change at the moment they know it, and the code
only decides whether to *show* it: does the update cross ``since``, and
does this stack have the component the change touches?

Adding an entry is the whole maintenance cost, and it happens once, in
the same PR that changes the behavior.
