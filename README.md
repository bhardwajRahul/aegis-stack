You need to ship reliable software, but management only gave you 2 weeks.

No time for health checks, proper testing, or clean architecture. Just enough time for duct tape and hope.

**What if you could go from idea to working prototype in the time it takes to grab coffee?**

![Aegis Stack Quick Start Demo](docs/images/aegis-demo.gif)

Aegis Stack is a modular Python framework that grows with your projects — start with an API, add Auth, Scheduler, Workers, or AI services when you need them.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Required for the standard development workflow (`make serve`). Generated projects use Docker for consistent environments and service dependencies (Redis for workers, health monitoring, etc.).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run instantly without installation
uvx aegis-stack init my-api

# Create with user authentication
uvx aegis-stack init user-app --services auth

# Create with background processing
uvx aegis-stack init task-processor --components scheduler,worker

# Start building
cd my-api && uv sync && cp .env.example .env && make serve
```

**Installation alternatives:** See the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for `uv tool install`, `pip install`, and development setup.

## 🌱 Your Stack Grows With You

**Your choices aren't permanent.** Start with what you need today, add components when requirements change, remove what you outgrow.

```bash
# Monday: Ship MVP
aegis init my-api

# Week 3: Add scheduled reports
aegis add scheduler --project-path ./my-api

# Month 2: Need async workers
aegis add worker --project-path ./my-api

# Month 6: Scheduler not needed
aegis remove scheduler --project-path ./my-api
```

| Framework | Add Later? | Remove Later? | Git Conflicts? |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Others** | ❌ Locked at init | ❌ Manual deletion | ⚠️ High risk |
| **Aegis Stack** | ✅ One command | ✅ One command | ✅ Auto-handled |

![Component Evolution Demo](docs/images/aegis-evolution-demo.gif)

Most frameworks lock you in at `init`. Aegis Stack doesn't. See **[Evolving Your Stack](docs/evolving-your-stack.md)** for the complete guide.

## See It In Action

### Overseer - Built-In Health Monitoring

![Overseer](docs/images/overseer-demo.gif)

**[Overseer](docs/overseer/index.md)** is the read-only health monitoring dashboard built into every Aegis Stack project. It provides real-time visibility into all your components (Backend, Database, Worker, Scheduler) and services (Auth, AI, Comms) through a web UI and CLI commands.

No Datadog. No New Relic. No vendor lock-in. Just centralized monitoring you own from day one.

### CLI Health Monitoring

![CLI Health Check](docs/images/cli_health_check.png)

Rich terminal output showing detailed component status, health metrics, and system diagnostics.

## For The Veterans

![Ron Swanson](docs/images/ron-swanson.gif)

No magic. No reinventing the wheel. Just the tools you already know, pre-configured and ready to compose.

Aegis Stack respects your expertise. We maintain existing standards - FastAPI for APIs, SQLModel for databases, arq for workers. No custom abstractions or proprietary patterns to learn. Pick your components, get a production-ready foundation, and build your way.

The framework gets out of your way so you can get started.
